Problem Statement:

	Heard of the Kaprekar's constant ? Here's how you can calculate it.
Take any four digit number (whose digits are not all identical),say, 3141.Then do the following:

(1)	Rearrange the digits to form the largest and smallest 4-digit numbers possible.
(2) Take these two numbers and subtract the smaller number from the larger.
(3) Use the number you obtain and repeat the above process.   

,i.e, 4311-1134=3177 , 7731-1377=6354 ...... and so on 

	After some steps, you will get a number X . If you apply the above procedure on X , you will get back X . This number is called the Kaprekar's constant.
	The input to your program will be a 4 digit number 'n' . You program must output the no of steps taken to reach X.

Constraints:

(1) n will be between 1000 and 9998, both  inclusive

Time Limit: 200 msecs

Examples:

(1) 
Input : 1004

Output	 : 7

Explanation : 1004 => 4086 => 8172 => 7443 ...  X
	
(2) 
Input : 1000

Output	 : 5

Explanation : 1000 => 0999 => 8991 ... X
