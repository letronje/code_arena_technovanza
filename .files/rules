<p align="center"><span style="font-size:24pt;color:#ff0000">Coder's Arena</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:15pt">Welcome to the </span><span style="font-size:15pt;font-weight:600">TECHNOVANZA 2005</span><span style="font-size:15pt"> Programming Contest Final</span></p>
<p><br />Please go through all the instructions carefully before you proceed.DONOT register till we tell , otherwise you will be disqualified immediately.</p>
<p>NOTE: In a problem , &quot;Time Limit = x ms&quot; means your program should give output within 'x' milli seconds. <br />NOTE: We are not responsible for any faults in computer hardware</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Registration : </span><br /><br />The first step is to register your team by clicking on the <span style="font-weight:600">Register</span> button.</p>
<p>Note: All the contestants will receive the same set of problems , irrespective of your year (FE,SE,TE,BE,etc)</p>
<p>After you register successfully, you will receive the problem list .<br /><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Problems : </span><br /><br />You will be provided with 2 questions(NO MCQs) . TOTAL CONTEST TIME = 20 Minutes ONLY ( for BOTH the questions combined).</p>
<p>Top 2 from each Elim batch will be considered for finals.<br /><br />1st  question--&gt; 100 points <br />2nd question--&gt; 200 points <br /><br />Your objective is to solve both questions ( 100 from group 1 and 200 from group 2) .Higher the points allocated to the question, greater will be the difficulty.<br />The moment you choose the first problem,the total contest time starts counting time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Solution : </span><br /><br />Your solution will be like any other C or C++ program. You can include and use any function from the standard C or C++ library by including the corresponding header file.Your code must contain a <span style="color:#c34100">main</span> function returning an int.Your program must take input(s) from the standard input by using <span style="color:#8b008b">scanf,cin,etc </span>and display output(s) to the standard output using <span style="color:#8b008b">printf , cout , etc</span>. </p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>1&gt; Donot display anything of the type &quot;Enter input&quot;,&quot;Enter 2 nos &quot; ,etc , JUST cin OR scanf</p>
<p>2&gt; Similarly, Donot display anything of the type &quot;The output is : &quot;  , JUST cout or printf </p>
<p>sample c/c++ program to add 2 nos</p>
<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
<p>int main ()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>	int a,b;</p>
<p>	scanf(&quot;%d%d&quot;,&amp;a,&amp;b); // OR cin&gt;&gt;a&gt;&gt;b;</p>
<p>	printf(&quot;%d&quot;,a+b) ; // OR cout &lt;&lt; a+b;</p>
<p>	return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>The output of your program must exactly match the expected predetermined output .You may,however, display other output(s) in between the program, for debugging purposes. However, <span style="font-weight:600">do not forget to remove these intermediate output(s) </span>before submitting , else, your program will be considered wrong and no points will be awarded for that question . <span style="font-weight:600">conio.h</span> is not considered as a standard header file and must not be included for using functions like <span style="font-weight:600">getch()</span>.Use of Standard Template Library (STL) is permitted. <br /><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Creating a Solution : </span><br /><br />After you select a problem ,click the <span style="font-weight:600">Go</span> button.You will be presented with the Main Coding Window.<br /><br /><img src=/home/arena.png ><span style="font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#a20000">Problem : </span><br />The problem statement is shown in top right pane .It includes an explanation of the task, all of the constraints for any input parameters, and examples to help clarify the rest of the statement . Read it thoroughly.<span style="color:#a20000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#a20000">Coding : </span><br />The code is to be written in the left pane(Editor).As you write the code , it is automatically saved.<span style="color:#a20000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#a20000">Compiling : </span><br />You can compile your code by clicking the <span style="font-weight:600">Compile</span> button or using the shortcu Ctrl+F9 . If a compilation is successful, you will be notified of such. If the compilation is not successful, the errors that are returned by the compiler will be displayed to you in the Compilation Results Window in the right bottom area of the Editor.<br /><br />The Compiler Output ,Editor and Problem Statement pane can be maximized by double clicking on them and restored by again double clicking on them. <span style="color:#a20000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#a20000">User Testing : </span><br />You can test your program by clicking the <span style="font-weight:600">Test</span> button or using the shortcut Ctrl+T .<br /><br /><img src=/home/test.png > To testing your code for the examples provided in the problem , select an example from the <span style="font-weight:600">Input</span>combo box. Just because your code produces the proper results for all examples does not necessarily mean that it will produce the proper result for other input parameters . So, you can test your code with your own <span style="font-weight:600">Custom</span> inputs ( you will need to make your own determination as to whether the output is correct ) . Think about potential border cases that may cause variations in the behavior of your solution and test these cases thoroughly. Please note that your code must display the output <span style="font-weight:600">within the specified time limit </span>for any input within the input range mentioned in the problem. <span style="color:#a20000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#a20000">Submitting : </span><br />Once you are sure that your program is correct , you can submit it to the server for testing using the <span style="font-weight:600">Submit</span> button or by using the shortcut (Alt + U).You do have the option of submitting a problem multiple times. PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR CODE ATLEAST 30 seconds before your time is over <span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000">.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Scoring : </span><br /><br />The point value of a submission is dependent upon the problem's level of difficulty and the time it took to code the solution.The server will calculate the time spent on a problem by counting the time between when you selected the problem and when a solution was submitted.<br /><br />Suppose, after you've already submitted a problem, you discover an error in your submission, you may submit that problem again. However, there is a penalty for doing so. Upon re-submission, two things will happen to your score: 1) the additional time elapsed between the previous submission and the most recent will be factored into your new point total, and 2) you will be <span style="font-weight:600">penalized 10% of the maximum value of the problem </span>that you've resubmitted. In other words, if you resubmit a problem worth 500 points, you will incur a 50-point penalty in addition to the loss of points associated with the additional elapsed time.<span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Timer : </span><br /><br />The timer in the coding window will be always counting down to the end of the contest. <span style="font-weight:600">Once the time of the contest is over, you can Code,Compile and Test your code but wonâ€™t be allowed to submit </span>.<span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Options : </span><br /><br />By Clicking the <span style="font-weight:600">Options</span> button , you can change behaviour of the application according to your convenience. <br />Note : Donot change IP Address of the Server unless told to do so.<span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Server Testing : </span><br />At the end of the contest, the server will check the submitted codes against an exhaustive set of inputs. This process is automated and will take a couple of minutes depending on the number of submitted codes &amp; the no of contestants . Each input case for a given problem will carry different weights (in percent of the problem points). You will get full points (equal to the submitted score) if your code satisfies all the input cases. If your code produces wrong output even for a single input case , a very small score will be awarded to you.<span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Submissions : </span><br />You can see the submissions of the other contestants by clicking the<span style="font-weight:600">Submissions</span> button or by using the shortcut ( Alt + S ). Note that the Submissions Window displays only the points for which the other coders have submitted their problems and not their final score.<br /><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:12pt;font-weight:600;text-decoration:underline;color:#550000">Result : </span><br />You can see the results in the Results Window by clicking the<span style="font-weight:600">Result</span> button or by using the shortcut ( Alt + R ). The results will be activated only after the contest is over and all the submitted codes have been tested.<br /><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#550000"><br /></span>If you have any queries, feel free to ask the Event Heads ( Harshad Telang or Manoj Mathai ).<br /><br />Enough of formalities! So Get Ready to Rumble in the Codersâ€™ Arena!! </p>
